You are provided with the output from Whisper transcription, structured as follows:

```
{
  "text": "Full transcript text.",
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 10.2,
      "text": " Segment text."
    },
    // more segments
  ]
}
```

Your task is to extract every distinct statement (every distinct claim made) defined as a single coherent opinion or fact from the segments provided, along with its precise timestamps. Follow these rules:

### What to Extract
- Merge consecutive segments that together form a complete statement. Ensure that the start time is taken from the first segment and the end time from the last segment included in the merged statement.
- Classify each extracted statement as either a "fact" (an objective, verifiable claim) or an "opinion" (a subjective judgment or personal viewpoint). The truthfulness of a statement does not influence this classification.
- Ignore irrelevant or incomplete statements.
- You may add contextual information for statements to stand alone and remain fully understandable.

### Output Format
Return a JSON array ordered by `start` time, where each element is:

```json
{
  "start": <seconds>,
  "end": <seconds>,
  "claim_text": "<exact copy of the complete statement>",
  "type": "fact" | "opinion"
}
```

### Example Input
```json
{
  "text": "We're going to take care of our country. Wow, look at all the people up there. It's a big balcony. Hello, balcony.",
  "segments": [
    {"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.2, "text": " We're going to take care of our country."},
    {"id": 1, "start": 10.2, "end": 13.04, "text": " Wow, look at all the people up there."},
    {"id": 2, "start": 13.04, "end": 14.04, "text": " It's a big balcony."},
    {"id": 3, "start": 14.04, "end": 15.04, "text": " Hello, balcony."}
  ]
}
```

### Example Output
```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.0,
    "end": 10.2,
    "claim_text": "We're going to take care of our country.",
    "type": "opinion"
  },
  {
    "start": 10.2,
    "end": 13.04,
    "claim_text": "Look at all the people up there.",
    "type": "opinion"
  },
  {
    "start": 13.04,
    "end": 14.04,
    "claim_text": "It's a big balcony.",
    "type": "fact"
  }
]
```

If there weren't any claims, output an empty array: 
[]

Remember to output strictly following this format without any additional text or explanation.
