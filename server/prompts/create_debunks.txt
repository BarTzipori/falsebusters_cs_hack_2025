You are provided with a JSON array containing claims structured as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.0,
    "end": 10.2,
    "claim_text": "We're going to take care of our country.",
    "type": "opinion"
  },
  {
    "start": 10.2,
    "end": 13.04,
    "claim_text": "Look at all the people up there.",
    "type": "opinion"
  }
  // More claims
]
```

Your task is to assess each claim for misinformation or logical inaccuracies. Follow these instructions:

### Process

* Evaluate each claim individually.

* Classify each claim into one of three categories:

  * **Incorrect Information** (factually false)
  * **Logical Fallacies** (errors in reasoning)
  * **Unverifiable** (cannot confidently determine truthfulness)

* If necessary, verify factual claims using reliable online sources.

### Output Requirements

* Only include claims that contain misinformation, logical fallacies, or cannot be confidently verified ("unverified").
* Assign a unique numeric "id" to each claim starting from 1.
* Set the severity as follows:

  * **"high"** for clearly incorrect or misleading claims.
  * **"low"** for claims with logical errors or inaccuracies of minor impact.
  * **"unverified"** for claims whose truthfulness cannot be determined.

### Output JSON Format

Return a JSON array with each item formatted as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "start": <seconds>,
    "end": <seconds>,
    "claim_text": "Exact text of the claim",
    "debunking_information": "Brief explanation of why the claim is incorrect or logically flawed. Leave empty if unverified.",
    "severity": "low" | "high" | "unverified",
    "misinformation_type": "factual" | "logical"
  }
  // More debunked claims
]
```

### Important

* Exclude claims that are accurate, irrelevant, or have negligible misinformation risk.
* If the claim's truthfulness cannot be determined, explicitly mark it as "unverified" with empty "debunking\_information".
