"{'text': \"Also, yesterday, Bret Baier had an interview with Bernie Sanders. And Bernie is on this trip, the oligarch tour, all over the country and getting big crowds. And he preaches about how the wealthy, how the rich are controlling our political system. And he wants to stand with the working class. But then Bret asked him if that's the case, and you're so into the carbon footprint and so into energy, why are you flying on a private plane? Isn't that hypocritical? Listen to this. When's the last time you saw Donald Trump during a campaign mode at National Airport? No, no, no. It doesn't. But he's also not fighting the oligarchy. No. You run a campaign, and you do three or four or five rallies in a week. The only way you can get around to talk to 30,000 people. Think I'm going to be sitting on a waiting line at United waiting while 30,000 people are waiting? That's the only way you can get around. No apologies for that. That's what campaign travel is about. We've done it in the past. We're going to do it in the future. No one is asking you to apologize, but stop bashing other people for using their private jet. By the way, you can pull it off with United. You're just going to have to stay in line long. You're going to have to deal with all the delays that all of us, the American people that you say that you represent, have to deal with. And by the way, President Trump has never shied away from being the flashy businessman that has wealth. He never bashes wealth. That's what he does. So it is this that goes against his message. Remember he used to say he was against the millionaires and billionaires. But when he became a millionaire, he stopped saying the millionaires. He only says billionaires now. When he talks, my eyes roll on my head. He says the same thing all the time. He's done the same thing for 50, 60 years. He brings nothing to the table except for he's never done anything. He's never implemented anything. He can't say what I've done in my small town, what I've done in Vermont, what I've been able to transform, the legislation I sponsored. Nothing. All he does is rant and rave in an isolated party and be critical of people. Also, he points out rich people. If you look at Jeff Bezos, he was rich because he took tremendous risks to run Amazon. Because you're rich, it doesn't mean you're bad. In fact, success leaves clues. Most billionaires in this country are first generation billionaires. They provide opportunity. And hey, if you're concerned about your carbon footprint like every other Democrat, you will afford that inflation reduction new green deal that was passed. If you're concerned about that and you want us all in electric cars, then why are you flying to five places, go to two places, and take a plane, or a bus, or a Prius? But this is socialism for you. Exactly. This is socialism. Always the people that are part of the socialist regime always have special exemptions for themselves. He preaches one thing and does another. Yeah, Joe Biden was also interviewed by the BBC. It was his first in-depth interview since he left office. And he talked about the decision to drop out of the race, saying it was difficult. Well, Bret Baier asked Bernie Sanders about that. Listen. Should President Biden have gotten out of that race earlier? But I'm not going back. You're not going back? No, I'm not. You know, I don't want to revert. Isn't that a big part of where the Democratic Party is? No, no, it's not. It's nothing to do with Biden right now or Kamala Harris. The question is, what is the fundamental issue in politics? Which side are you on? So right now, you have massive income and wealth inequality. You have the rich getting richer. Wealthiest people, large corporations control our economy. Billionaires control our political system. The question is, do you stand with the working class, with the elderly, with the kids? Or do you stand with big money? Well, that's a great question. That's another question. This is not going back because you guys haven't been honest about what took place during the Biden administration. And you guys covered up for him. And so now that we want to get to the truth of the matter, you guys just want to move on. The American people are tired of that. Every time you have a scandal, we just have to move on. We were right and we get demonized at the time. And then history goes by. Russia, Russia, Russia, COVID, Hunter Biden laptop. I mean, it's Biden's mental decay. We were called conspiracy theorists and now the record has come out. And you guys say, oh, we're moving on. We're onto the next topic. We're tired of that. Yeah, I know I hear you. I wish I could dispute anything you said. It's good that he comes on our channel and says his views. But I don't think anyone's listening. No one on the left thinks he's the future of the party. Nobody on the left thinks the future of the country is socialism. And he and AOC represent socialism. There's a lot of socialists who like seeing Bernie Sanders not comb his hair and speak for 30 minutes. But you're right. It's the same old song. We've been hearing the same message for years and years and years and it never works for the Democrats. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhardt.
